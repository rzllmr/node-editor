# Node Editor
> An intuitive editor for layouts of nodes and graphs.

The intention of this tool is to provide a free (meaning free to use, alter and distribute) editor for outlining mind-maps without hindering menus and configuration. That makes the waiver of hidden sub- and context-menus and a simple predefined style the main design principles of the project. Though customization of the look is still easily feasible through dedicated stylesheets.

Examples of the default layout and styling in a dark and light theme are:

## Build instructions

The project requires an installation of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) including its own package management system to satisfy all further dependencies. Those modules listed in the _packages.json_ are obtained automatically by executing the following line in the working tree root directory:

```sh
npm install
```

Following that you can run the program from source by executing:

```sh
npm start
```

And you can also use the next line to package the program as a self-containing executable:

```sh
npm run dist
```
